sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: when testing the sorted50000.txt, sort1 is way faster, because by data being sorted, it represent the best possible case, which makes Bubble sor O(n), contrary to Selection sort which is always O(n*2)

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: By far the fastest of the algorithms in most cases, more noticeable in the random txt files, as you increase the data.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: By exclusion this has to be Selection sort, and because also it takes around the same time, whether data is sorted or not.
